Hi, you've found my website! I don't update this very often, but I do try to occasionally collect my thoughts here on topics I find interesting. Most of the time, that means nerding out about urban transport topics, or data visualization on the web. Or maybe about my travels around Europe.

### Who is Billy?

I'm an American living in Berlin, Germany. My current research position at [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://vsp.tu-berlin.de) focuses on data visualization for the [MATSim transport simulation framework](https://matsim.org). MATSim is amazing, it can do anything -- right now it's getting a lot of attention for its ability to simulate traffic scenarios for the impending doomsday arrival of fleets of robot cars.
