It's unfortunate that we don't have a bard among us, for this leaves me to the humble task of recording our progress in this magic interactive cooperative vessel, known in our world as a "blog". And I am no scribe! Perhaps the others can contribute their points of view in poetry, song, art!

## That mess in the kitchen

Our new friend Dalmann really saved our skins this morning! I can't remember the last time an intrepid cleric tumbled into an adventure with such cinematic timing!!

Ho-hooo, we got lucky.

I'm not sure if we would have been able to get out of that kitchen alive without our new friend's help. Sadie had managed to slam the trapdoor shut, preventing any further mercs from... "getting to know us"... but for a moment there I thought we were goners. So our little exploration party has grown now to four. After an uneventful trip back to town to rest, we were ready to see what other secrets hid in this "haunted" house.

## Upstairs with... Ned

We all agreed that it would be best to explore and clear the upstairs of the house before venturing back down into the cellar, to avoid any unexpected surprises jumping us from behind.

After Dalmann's little mishap breaking through the floorboards this morning, it seemed best to go slowly and carefully from room to room. The door key casually lying on the floor, exactly in front of the locked room with the tied-up prisoner Ned, seemed too convenient to be true. Ned certainly seemed helpful and meek enough at first, although we all are wise enough to know better than to trust a stranger at first sight. (Well, except maybe Dalmann). Poor Sadie had to endure the attacks of hordes of little spiders but they were nothing we couldn't dispatch easily.

In fact, everything seemed a bit plodding and laborious, with no real treasure to speak of, and no ghosts or other such nonsense...

## Getting to the attic

...until we arrived in the north hall at a decrepit staircase, tantalizingly leading to an attic crawlspace which we could plainly see was used for storing some sacks, surely filled with treasure!

The problem was, Sadie's first steps onto the stairs were followed by loud splintering cracks and... no more stairs. :-) I cast light on one of the boards and tried to heave it into the space upstairs, to no avail. I tried sitting on Sadie's shoulders to see what secrets lie above... to no avail.

Well, I've never been much of an athlete (magic and potions are more my cup of tea, of course! Hoo-hoo!!) but Dalmann and Sadie convinced me to climb onto her shoulders and L-E-A-P to the attic! HA, that didn't work and I was left hanging by my fingertips!

The whole scene was quite comical as we broke things, fell on each other, and just plain failed at every attempt to get up there.

Ha, ha ha -- as we tried and tried to toss ropes, boards, anything at all and all of our ruckus awoke the six nasty little [Stirges](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=stirge&atb=v220-1&iax=images&ia=images) hiding within!

Believe me, you do not want six stirges coming for your blood. Their bite is nasty! The creatures immediately swooped down and attacked yours truly, Sadie, and GLERP. (Dalmann was still hanging back in a defensive position). Once they bite you, stirges STICK to you and suck blood, like awful carnivorous or blood-sucking bat/mosquito beasts.

Sadie used her bow to deftly impale one on the ceiling rafters. The others proceeded to attack us and injure us quite severely in turn -- Dalmann had to expend some of his healing powers, and I my last healing potion, to keep us in full health. But it turns out, while a stirge snacking on your leg is quite serious, its own skin is paper-thin and the slightest of successful attacks renders it harmless or dead.

## In the attic

Victory does have its spoils: one final attempted at tossing -ME- up into the attic (why didn't we try that before?) from the Dalmann's magically-repaired staircase (why didn't we try THAT before?) was finally successful.

This strange little sailor doll that I found by the sacks (full of junk)-- with deep jade eyes that are surely worth a fortune -- seems like it might be part of a larger story, perhaps even magical. What have we stumbled into in this rickety old house?

No ghosts so far, that's for sure.

And with that I take a small rest now.
