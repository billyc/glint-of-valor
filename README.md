A little blog for me and my adventure team.

- Based on Jekyll Now
- **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))
- **Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
